        <p>Sambal goreng is a traditional Indonesian stir-fried chili paste or sauce. It’s made by grinding or blending red chilies,
             shallots, garlic, tomatoes, and sometimes shrimp paste (terasi), 
             then stir-frying the mixture in oil until fragrant and the flavors develop.
        </p> 
        <p>The result is a rich, spicy, and slightly sweet condiment that pairs perfectly with rice, 
            fried foods, grilled meats, or vegetables. 
            Sambal goreng can also refer to dishes like sambal goreng kentang 
            (fried potatoes in chili sauce) or sambal goreng ati (beef liver in chili sauce), 
            where the sambal is cooked together with the main ingredients.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 red curly chilies (or mix with bird’s eye chilies for extra spiciness)</li>

            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li> 1 small red tomato</li>
            <li>½ tsp shrimp paste (<em>terasi</em>, optional, for a stronger flavor)</li>
            <li>1 tsp palm sugar or granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>50 ml cooking oil (for sautéing)</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Grind or roughly blend the chilies, shallots, garlic, tomato, and shrimp paste using a mortar and pestle or blender.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a pan.</li>
            <li>Sauté the chili mixture over medium heat, stirring constantly to avoid burning.</li>
